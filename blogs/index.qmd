## A Statistical Analysis in R using Linear Regression

For this analysis, we will use the Swiss dataset available in R.It contains data on fertility and various socioeconomic indicators for each of 47 French-speaking provinces in Switzerland in 1888. We can use linear regression to explore the relationships between fertility and other variables like agriculture, examination, education, Catholic, and infant mortality.

The `swiss` dataset in R is an excellent choice for linear regression analysis. It contains data on fertility and various socioeconomic indicators for each of 47 French-speaking provinces in Switzerland in 1888. We can use linear regression to explore the relationships between fertility and other variables like agriculture, examination, education, Catholic, and infant mortality.

Step 1: Load the datset

```{r}

data(swiss)

```

Step 2: Multiple linear regression models

```{r}

model_agriculture <- lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture, data=swiss)
model_examination <- lm(Fertility ~ Examination, data=swiss)
model_education <- lm(Fertility ~ Education, data=swiss)
model_catholic <- lm(Fertility ~ Catholic, data=swiss)
model_infantMortality <- lm(Fertility ~ Infant.Mortality, data=swiss)

```

Step 3: Plotting the results
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,3)) 
```

Step 4: Agriculture plot
```{r}
plot(swiss$Agriculture, swiss$Fertility, main="Fertility vs Agriculture",
     xlab="Agriculture", ylab="Fertility", pch=19)
abline(model_agriculture, col="blue")
```


Step 5: Examination plot
```{r}
plot(swiss$Examination, swiss$Fertility, main="Fertility vs Examination",
     xlab="Examination", ylab="Fertility", pch=19)
abline(model_examination, col="red")
```

Step 6: Education plot
```{r}
plot(swiss$Education, swiss$Fertility, main="Fertility vs Education",
     xlab="Education", ylab="Fertility", pch=19)
abline(model_education, col="green")
```

Step 7: Catholic plot
```{r}
plot(swiss$Catholic, swiss$Fertility, main="Fertility vs Catholic",
     xlab="Catholic", ylab="Fertility", pch=19)
abline(model_catholic, col="orange")
```

Step 8: Infant Mortality plot
```{r}
plot(swiss$Infant.Mortality, swiss$Fertility, main="Fertility vs Infant Mortality",
     xlab="Infant Mortality", ylab="Fertility", pch=19)
abline(model_infantMortality, col="purple")
```
